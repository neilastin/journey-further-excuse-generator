# Introducing the Journey Further Excuse Generator

## A Message from the Development Team

Let's be honest with each other for a moment.

You're not always going to do great work. Sometimes the brief was unclear. Sometimes the deadline was unreasonable. Sometimes you were distracted by that very important thing on Reddit. These things happen to the best of us, and by "the best of us" we mean everyone except the people who are somehow always on top of things. We don't understand those people either.

The real question isn't why things went wrong. That's ancient history. The question is: what are you going to say about it?

This is where we come in.

## What Is This Thing?

The Journey Further Excuse Generator is a sophisticated AI-powered tool that transforms your workplace mishaps into carefully crafted explanations. Think of it as a translator, except instead of translating between languages, it translates between "what actually happened" and "what you're going to tell everyone happened."

Simply describe your situation, select who you need to convince, and we'll provide you with two thoughtfully generated excuses:

- **The Believable Excuse** - For when you want to maintain professional relationships and the general illusion of competence
- **The Risky Excuse** - For when you're feeling bold, or your current excuse has stopped working

Both are equally fictional. Choose wisely.

## Why Would I Need This?

You wouldn't. You're a consummate professional who never misses deadlines, always remembers meetings, and has never once blamed a technology failure for something that was absolutely your fault.

But just in case someone you know might benefit from this tool, here's what it can do:

**Generate excuses for virtually any workplace scenario.** Forgot to send that email? Missed the client call? Accidentally deleted something important? Submitted work that was, let's say, "not your finest"? We've got you covered.

**Customise the tone and style.** Because sometimes you need corporate jargon, and sometimes you need something a bit more... creative.

**Create photographic evidence.** Yes, really. Upload your headshot and we'll generate an image that supports your excuse. Is this ethically questionable? Perhaps. Is it technically impressive? Absolutely.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Describe what happened.** Be specific. The AI needs details to craft a convincing alternative narrative.

2. **Select your audience.** Who needs convincing? Your manager? A colleague? The client? HR? Each requires a different approach to plausible deniability.

3. **Click the button.** Then wait while our AI does the hard work of reframing your reality.

4. **Review your options.** Copy whichever excuse fits your situation and confidence level.

5. **Generate photo evidence.** For when words alone won't suffice. Upload your headshot for personalised results, or don't - we'll create environmental evidence instead.

## Some Helpful Tips

**Be detailed in your description.** "I missed a deadline" is less useful than "I forgot to send the quarterly report because I was watching a documentary about cheese." The more context you provide, the better the excuse.

**Consider your audience carefully.** What works for a colleague won't necessarily work for the CEO. Though to be fair, most things don't work for the CEO.

**Don't overuse this tool.** If you're generating excuses daily, the problem might not be the excuses. Though we're not here to judge. Actually, we are. A little bit.

## A Note on the Photo Evidence Feature

We can't promise it will stand up in a court of law, but it should fool HR.

The photographic evidence feature allows you to generate images that visually support your excuse. You can upload your own headshot for personalised results, choose your image format depending on where you plan to share your fabricated reality, and even customise the outfit if you feel the need to dress for the occasion.

Sometimes our photographic evidence creation team do a good job, and sometimes they don't. If you're not completely satisfied with your evidence, you could always spend a few years mastering photo editing yourself.

Or, you could not be so guilty in the first place I guess.

### Sharing Your Masterpiece

Once you've generated your photographic evidence, you'll notice two buttons that appear with all the subtlety of someone who's just remembered they have an urgent dentist appointment.

**Share to Slack** - For when you want to immortalise your excuse in the #excuses channel where your colleagues can admire your creativity. One click, and your excuse (complete with evidence) will be posted anonymously for all to see. We say "anonymously" but let's be honest, everyone will know it's you. The button only works once per image because even we have limits to how much we'll enable your excuses clogging up the company Slack.

**Download** - For the more discreet excuse-maker. Download your evidence to share elsewhere, perhaps somewhere your manager isn't watching. Just remember to get permission from anyone whose face appears in the image. We can generate the excuse, but we can't help with the awkward conversation when Dave from Accounts discovers you've put him in a fabricated CCTV screenshot.

---

## Customisation Options

There's a "Customise" button. Click it if you want more control over your excuses. We're not going to explain everything it does because discovery is part of the fun, and also because this document is already quite long enough.

Just know that options exist, and they can make your excuses more... *you*.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is this ethical?**
That's between you and whatever moral framework you've chosen to adopt this week.

**Will this actually work?**
Define "work." Will it generate plausible-sounding excuses? Yes. Will your manager believe them? That depends entirely on your delivery and their credulity.

**What if someone finds out I'm using this?**
Then you'll need another excuse, and fortunately, we can help with that too. It's excuses all the way down.

**Can I use this for serious situations?**
You can use this however you like. We are a tool. We don't have opinions about your life choices.

**Is there a limit to how many excuses I can generate?**
No. Though again, if you're asking this question, we might suggest some self-reflection.

## In Conclusion

Look, we all know that accountability is important. Personal responsibility is valuable. Honest communication builds trust.

But also, sometimes the printer really did jam. The email really did go to spam. The traffic really was unprecedented.

And now you have a tool that helps you articulate these perfectly reasonable explanations with the eloquence and conviction they deserve.

Welcome to the Journey Further Excuse Generator.

May your excuses be creative, your evidence be convincing, and your actual mistakes remain forever undetected.
