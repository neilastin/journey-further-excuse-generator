**Random Selection:** ✅ Yes (included in random pool)

```
Use DEADPAN comedy:
- State completely outrageous things in a serious, matter-of-fact tone
- No exclamation marks, no dramatics - just calm delivery of absurd content
- Use formal, professional language to describe ridiculous situations
- The humor comes from the contrast between tone and content
- Examples: "I was engaged in a minor territorial dispute with a swan" or "A series of cascading failures in my morning routine"

**API Description:**
```
Use HYPERBOLIC comedy:

- Stack superlatives and extremes: epic, catastrophic, unprecedented
- Make small problems into world-ending events
- Examples: missed alarm becomes "apocalyptic chronological failure", traffic becomes "automotive gridlock of biblical proportions"
- Avoid clichés: Don't just add "super" or "really" - go ridiculously over the top
```

**Random Selection:** ❌ No (manual selection only - excluded from random pool)

**API Description:**
```
Use PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE comedy:
- Shift blame to others whilst maintaining plausible deniability
- Use phrases like "I would have finished if SOMEONE had...", "Apparently nobody thought to..."
- Imply incompetence or oversight from others without directly stating it
- Make it clear you're the victim of others' failures
- Examples: "I was waiting for the brief that never arrived" or "I assumed SOMEONE would mention the deadline change"

```

### 6. Ironic 🔄

**Random Selection:** ✅ Yes (included in random pool)

**API Description:**
```
Use IRONIC comedy:
- Say the opposite of what you mean to highlight contradictions
- Point out situations where the opposite of what should happen occurs
- Use dramatic irony - when trying to fix something makes it worse
- Highlight hypocrisy or contradictory outcomes
- Examples: "I was trying to be MORE responsible which is exactly why I'm late" or attempting to avoid a problem creates the problem
- Avoid clichés: Find genuine ironic twists, not just sarcasm
```

---

### 7. Meta 🎭

**Random Selection:** ✅ Yes (included in random pool)

**API Description:**
```
Use META comedy:
- Break the 4th wall - acknowledge you're making an excuse
- Reference the fact that this is obviously an excuse
- Be self-aware about how ridiculous/transparent the excuse is
- Comment on the excuse-making process itself
- Examples: "I'm aware this sounds like an excuse, which it absolutely is, but..." or "The beauty of this explanation is that it's technically true while being completely misleading"
- Avoid clichés: Don't just say "I know this sounds fake" - play with the meta-ness creatively

```

---

### 9. Corporate Jargon 💼

**Random Selection:** ❌ No (manual selection only - excluded from random pool)

**API Description:**
```
Use CORPORATE JARGON comedy:
- Drown the excuse in business buzzwords, management speak, and corporate nonsense
- Use phrases like "synergize", "leverage", "circle back", "move the needle", "paradigm shift"
- Turn simple failures into "strategic pivots" or "optimization opportunities"
- Reference frameworks, KPIs, OKRs, and other acronyms excessively
- Examples: "bandwidth constraints impacted deliverable velocity" or "a misalignment of stakeholder expectations created friction in the value stream"
- Avoid clichés: Don't just sprinkle buzzwords - build entire sentences of corporate gibberish that sound professional but mean nothing

This is your comedic angle, but you still have creative freedom in execution.
```

**API Description:**
```

ROBIN SKIDMORE - CEO & Founder of Journey Further

Random bits of information about Robin:
- CEO and a founder of Journey Further
- He is high energy, passionate and enthusiastic
- He is an Essex lad
- He used to work in the sales team and fancies himself to be a brilliant salesman and brilliant in pitches
- He is a bit of a neat freak
- He loves his Peloton
- There is a running joke that he gets his hair cut so very regularly, unusually regularly
- He has invested in varied other ventures before (with mixed results)

[More details to be added by colleagues over time]

IMPORTANT MIXING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Mix generic CEO/founder stereotypes with Robin-specific details to keep excuses varied
- Sometimes lean heavily on generic CEO tropes: ambitious, workaholic, strategic pivots,
  "synergy" obsession, motivational speaker energy, hustle culture, vision boards, etc.
- Sometimes weave in Robin-specific details from the persona above
- Sometimes combine both approaches for maximum comedy
- Keep the tone affectionate and cheeky, never mean-spirited
- Make it clear the excuse is blaming Robin in a playful way (not genuinely malicious)

This ensures each excuse about Robin feels fresh and unpredictable, not repetitive.
This is your comedic angle, but you still have creative freedom in execution.
